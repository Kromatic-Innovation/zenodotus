#!/usr/bin/env bash
# public-safe-lint.sh — a portable, org-agnostic file-shape scanner.
#
# The scanner invoked by the companion public-safe-lint.template.yml
# workflow. This script carries ZERO organization-specific strings -- only
# generic SHAPES that any open-source repository would want to catch in its
# own CI, including on pull requests from outside contributors where no
# repository secret is ever injected:
#   - local absolute filesystem paths (a personal username or home directory
#     leaking into a public file)
#   - home-directory-relative paths
#   - bare numeric issue references with no repository qualifier
#   - plus-addressed email aliases (personal test-account leakage)
#   - personal-attribution phrases
#
# This script must never be pointed at, or combined with, any private
# pattern inventory -- doing so would defeat the point of keeping it
# adoptable on fork pull requests, which receive no injected secrets or
# private config of any kind.
#
# bare-issue-ref and already-qualified links: a `#N` that is the
# link text of an already-fully-qualified GitHub issue/PR URL --
# `[#N](https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/issues/N)` or `.../pull/N` -- is not a
# leak (GitHub already resolved it correctly) and is excluded by construction
# before this rule's hits are reported. This is a fixed logic correction, not
# a suppression a repo opts into.
#
# Suppression mechanism: an adopting repo may commit a
# `.public-safe-lintignore` file at the root of the tree being scanned to
# exempt specific paths from specific named rules -- for example a repo's own
# CHANGELOG.md citing its own already-public issue history, or a leak-
# detector's test fixtures that deliberately contain the shapes this script
# looks for. Format: one `<rule-name> <path-glob>` pair per line (whitespace-
# separated), `#`-prefixed lines and blank lines ignored. Example:
#
#   bare-issue-ref CHANGELOG.md
#   bare-issue-ref README.md
#   bare-issue-ref tests/fixtures/**
#
# This is exclusion by path + rule name ONLY -- never by literal content, org
# name, or company term, so it cannot be used to smuggle a term-allowlist
# through the back door. The file lives in the adopting repo's own committed
# tree (never in public-safe-lint.sh or public-safe-lint.template.yml, and
# never injected as a secret), so it is present identically on a fork PR.
# Deciding what to exempt is each adopting repo's own policy call -- this
# script ships the mechanism, not a default exemption list.
#
# Output discipline: this script reports file:line and a rule name only --
# it never prints the matched substring itself. A linter that prints the
# matched text into a public CI log republishes exactly what a leak-detector
# exists to prevent, so this discipline holds even though every pattern
# here is a generic shape rather than a specific secret.
#
# Every run also asserts, before trusting any clean result, that a known-bad
# seed value actually matches at least one rule (see the canary block
# below) -- this guards against a scanner that silently matches nothing
# while still reporting success.

Scans <path-to-scan> for org-agnostic public-safety shapes (local absolute
paths, bare issue refs, +alias emails, personal-attribution phrases). Prints
file:line and rule name only -- never the matched text. Exits non-zero on
any hit, on a canary failure, or on a usage error.

An optional <path-to-scan>/.public-safe-lintignore file exempts specific

RULE_COUNT="${#RULES[@]}"

# --- Per-rule canary: before trusting a clean verdict, prove that EVERY
# rule still matches a known-bad seed of its OWN. Guards two fail-open shapes
# per rule: BSD sed's \b silently behaving as a no-op, and a '|'-joined
# alternation silently aborting the whole expression. Both exit 0 and look
# like they ran.
#
# This is deliberately per-rule, not suite-aggregate (cwc#2025). A canary
# that probes rules only until the first one matches, then stops, cannot
# tell "all N rules live" from "rule 1 lives and rules 2..N silently went
# dead" -- it reports "matched at least one of N", a numerator with the
# denominator printed next to it as if the two were equal. That is exactly
# the silent-pass shape this scanner exists to prevent, reappearing inside
# the guard meant to prevent it. So each rule is probed independently
# against only its own seed, and any rule that fails to match is NAMED and
# fails the whole run -- a bare "canary failed" would reproduce the same
# numerator-only reporting.
#
# Every seed is assembled from sub-fragments rather than written as a single
# contiguous literal. This script is copied verbatim into adopting repos and
# scanned along with everything else (the run step is fixed:
# `bash public-safe-lint.sh .`) -- a seed that appeared as a matchable
# literal in this file's own source would make the script flag ITSELF on
# every adopting repo, permanently failing the required check even on an
# otherwise-clean tree. Splitting the fragments keeps each *assembled*
# runtime seed a faithful known-bad value (it still matches its rule once
# written to a seed file) while no source line here matches any rule.
#
# SEEDS is index-aligned with RULES: SEEDS[i] is a line that rule i, and
# rule i alone, is required to match. Adding a rule above WITHOUT adding its
# seed here trips the count guard below -- a new rule cannot ship unvouched.
